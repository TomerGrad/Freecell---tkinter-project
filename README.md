# Freecell - tkinter-project

Here I was tried to implement one of my favorite solitaire game - FreeCell. Information and game-rules could be find here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell.
This game was built with the "keep it simple" philosophy, which means that I used only with the built-in modules: tkinter and random.

Have fun!
